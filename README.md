# Scott Schroeder's Portfolio

Howdy! This is my portfolio. Please feel free to look through the code if you'd like to see how anything works.

This application is built using React and TypeScript and has been pre-wired up to accept an upcoming Content API.

## Scripts

- `npm start` - starts a dev version of the site available at http://localhost:3000 
- `npm run build` - builds the app for deployment to production to the build folder
- `npm run eject` - This is a one-way operation - don't do this unless you already know what you're getting into.
